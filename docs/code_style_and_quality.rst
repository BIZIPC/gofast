Code Style and Quality for GoFast
=================================

As a contributor to GoFast, it's important to maintain a high standard of code quality and 
adhere to the project's coding style guidelines.

Adhering to PEP8 Coding Standards
---------------------------------

GoFast follows the PEP8 style guide for Python code:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Limit lines to 79 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.
- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.
- Use docstrings for modules, functions, classes, and methods.

Writing Readable and Concise Code
---------------------------------

- **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Write code that is easy to understand, avoiding overly complex constructions.
- **Self-explanatory Variable Names**: Choose names that reflect the purpose or nature of the variable.
- **Function Length**: Ideally, keep functions short and focused. A single function should perform one task or action.

Best Practices for Using Version Control
----------------------------------------

- **Feature Branches**: Develop new features in separate branches.
- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what".
- **Pull Requests**: When your feature or fix is ready, submit a pull request against the main branch of the GoFast repository.
