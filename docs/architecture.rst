Architecture of GoFast
=======================

.. _GoFast-Architecture:

Overview
--------

GoFast is a comprehensive machine learning toolbox designed to accelerate and streamline data 
science workflows. This document provides an overview of GoFast's architecture, highlighting its 
modular design, key components, and the philosophy behind its structure.

Modular Design
--------------

The architecture of GoFast is modular, comprising several subpackages, each targeting specific 
aspects of machine learning workflows.

1. **Preprocessing Module**: For fast and efficient data preprocessing, including cleaning, 
   normalization, and feature engineering.

2. **Modeling Module**: Contains various machine learning models optimized for speed and 
   performance.

3. **Validation Module**: Provides tools for model evaluation and validation, ensuring the 
   robustness of machine learning models.

4. **Utility Functions**: A collection of utility functions that support data manipulation 
   and other common tasks.

5. **Pipeline Creation**: Tools for creating streamlined workflows, combining multiple steps 
   into coherent pipelines.

Philosophy
----------

GoFast's architecture is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Efficiency**: Focus on maximizing computational efficiency and reducing processing time.

- **User-Friendly**: Ensuring the library is accessible to users of varying skill levels.

- **Community-Driven Development**: Emphasizes open-source collaboration and community 
  contributions.

- **Scalability**: Structured to handle a range of data sizes, from small datasets to 
  large-scale data processing.
