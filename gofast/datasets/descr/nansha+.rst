The Nansha data was collected during the Nashang project from 2018 to 2019. The primary focus of the 
drilling was engineering drillings for controlling soil settlement and quality. Additionally, several 
hydrogeological drillings were also performed. The overarching goal of the Nanshang project is to forecast 
land subsidence from 2024 to 2035 using various influential factors, including InSAR data, highways map, 
proximity to roads, rivers (such as the Pearl River), and others.
