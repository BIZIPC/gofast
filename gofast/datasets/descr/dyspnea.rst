The Dyspnea Dataset, collected from CÃ´te d'Ivoire, represents a significant effort to compile clinical data on patients experiencing 
dyspnea. It stands as a valuable resource for medical research, offering insights into the prevalence, causes, and outcomes of 
respiratory distress across a diverse patient population. By analyzing this dataset, researchers can contribute to the development 
of more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for dyspnea and its underlying conditions.

    - Demographic data: age, sex
	- Clinical measurements: heart rate (fc), respiratory rate (fr), blood oxygen saturation (spo), temperature, Glasgow Coma Scale score (glasgow_score)
	- Diagnoses: including but not limited to pneumonitis, asthma attack, pulmonary tuberculosis, COVID-19, heart failure, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), bronchial cancer, and pulmonary fibrosis
	- Symptom and history indicators: dyspnea, NYHA (New York Heart Association) intensity, frequency of symptoms, cough, fever, asthenia, exposure to tobacco and alcohol
	- Outcome measures: diagnosis retained, outcome of hospitalization
