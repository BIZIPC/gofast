**Dataset Description:**

The "JRS bet" dataset encapsulates the intriguing world of the Ghanaian lottery, a popular game of chance in Ghana, West Africa. 
This dataset uniquely captures the mechanics of the lottery, where participants propose ten numbers, grouped in five pairs 
(e.g., 00-11-23-33-44). These numbers are specifically even-numbered pairs, meaning they are taken two by two from the range 
00-99. 
Each weekend, the lottery draw reveals five winning and five losing numbers. To emerge victorious in this game, a bettor's selection 
of ten numbers (grouped as five pairs) must include at least one pair that matches any of the pairs in the winning set. The order 
of the numbers in the pair is irrelevant. Additionally, none of the bettor's pairs should correspond with any pair in the losing 
set. For instance, on 2018-05-04, the winning numbers were 46-48-79-43-20, and the losing numbers were 63-86-82-37-19. A player 
who chose pairs like 46-48 or 79-20 would win, while selections like 00-10 or 56-45, which do not match any winning pairs, would 
lose. Moreover, if any number in a player's pair appears in the losing numbers, the player is automatically disqualified.

The dataset illustrates the exciting dynamics of the lottery â€“ the more pairs a player matches with the winning numbers, the 
greater their rewards. This system creates a thrilling experience where players aspire to match as many pairs as possible with
the winning numbers to maximize their winnings.

The "JRS bet" offers a comprehensive view of the lottery outcomes, providing insights into patterns and trends that could be 
valuable for statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and understanding the probabilities involved in this popular Ghanaian 
game.

** Important Notes:**
