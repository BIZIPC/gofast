Dataset Description
-------------------

This dataset comprises 276 instances of daily environmental and meteorological measurements, including temperature,
humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, evapotranspiration, rainfall, and flow measurements. It is aimed at supporting studies 
in environmental science, agriculture, meteorology, and hydrology, particularly for understanding weather patterns, climate impact 
on agriculture, or water resource management. The dataset covers various aspects of environmental conditions that can be used for 
regression, time series analysis, and other associated tasks in data analysis and predictive modeling.
